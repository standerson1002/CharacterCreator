    <h4>Traits</h4>
    <p>The main source for traits is <a href="https://ideonomy.mit.edu/essays/traits.html" target="_blank">Ideonomy MIT</a> from 1998-05-10. Additional traits were added and some of the traits from the list were excluded. Some connotations were updated. Definitions paraphrased using sources like <a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a> and other online dictionaries.</p>
    <h4>Locations</h4>
    <p>List of countries, cities, and subdivisions were gathered through personal knowledge and references like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/" target="_blank">World Population Review</a>. All character accents were removed because they were displayed strangely.</p>
